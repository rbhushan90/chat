To do
=====
check that User is authenticated first before creating Room else null owner


Event listeners
---------------
1. each time you add a listener for the same event, it is PUSHED into a stack.

on "message-add" event
----------------------
all listeners for this event will get the same message.
You need to filter by roomId to get the messages you want

Quirks
------
Once you are invited, you are authorised to use the Room.
Accept/Decline does not affect permission.
To do : if User decline, remove user from  /room-metadata/{room}/authorisedUsers/{user}

Order of Execution
------------------
1. Firechat.setUser(userId, userName, onComplete)

2. add listeners

3. Firechat.enterRoom(roomId)
