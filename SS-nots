To do
=====
check that User is authenticated first before creating Room else null owner


Event listeners
---------------
1. each time you add a listener for the same event, it is PUSHED into a stack.

Quirks
------
Once you are invited, you are authorised to use the Room.
Accept/Decline does not affect permission.
To do : if User decline, remove user from  /room-metadata/{room}/authorisedUsers/{user}

Order of Execution
------------------
1. Firechat.setUser(userId, userName, onComplete)
2. add listeners
3. Firechat.enterRoom(roomId)

Firechat.js : I have customised this file !! Renamed to firechat_ssedit.js
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Added Sequence Id to (1) room-metadata and (2) room-messages
(2) Deleted the FirechatUI functions (not used ! removed to reduce file size)

scroll
------
(1) use angular-ui-scroll for scrolling.
  $ bower install angular-ui-scroll

(2) How to load a list from a  starting point ---> Chat.adapter.reload(startIndex);
